# PhoneNet

Phonenet is a Fast, Efficient and Elegant Android Neural Network with strong GPU acceleration. It's just a forward neural network without back-propagation, which means, you can train your model via Tensorflow and Pytorch and then export the model to file. PhoneNet can import your model structure and parameters automatically without too much man-hand work. Currently The project is under development. The first support model is SqueezeNet. We will implement the most efficient model used in computer vision and NLP.
